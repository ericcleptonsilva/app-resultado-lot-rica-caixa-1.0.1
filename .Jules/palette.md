## 2026-02-09 - Accessible Number Grids
**Learning:** Interactive number grids built with `div`s and `onClick` are completely inaccessible to keyboard users and screen readers.
**Action:** Always use `<button type="button">` for interactive grid items and reset default button styles (`appearance: none`, `padding: 0`, `border: none`) to maintain design fidelity while gaining semantic benefits and keyboard focus.

## 2026-10-25 - Inline Destructive Actions
**Learning:** Using browser alerts for confirmation feels jarring and outdated. Inline confirmation (swapping the button) keeps context and flow.
**Action:** For list items, use a local state (e.g., `deletingId`) to render confirmation buttons in place of the action button, maintaining spatial context.

## 2026-10-25 - Strategic Complexity vs Simplicity
**Learning:** Users want "advanced" features like Gail Howard's strategies but don't want to configure complex parameters.
**Action:** Encapsulate complex logic (Sum ranges, Even/Odd ratios) into a simple "Smart Pick" button that "just works", providing immediate value without friction.

## 2026-10-25 - Accessible Tabs Navigation
**Learning:** Custom tab implementations using `div`s and `button`s lack semantic meaning for screen readers. Users rely on `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `role="tabpanel"` to understand the structure.
**Action:** Always wrap tab buttons in a container with `role="tablist"` and use `aria-selected` and `aria-controls`. Wrap content in `role="tabpanel"` and link via `aria-labelledby`.

## 2026-10-25 - Actionable AI Outputs & robust aria-live
**Learning:** AI-generated content (like predictions) must be immediately actionable (e.g., via a "Jogar Agora" button) to reduce user friction. Additionally, async state transitions and loading areas should robustly use `aria-live` and `aria-busy` to dynamically announce status to screen readers, while corresponding interactive buttons should explicitly manage `aria-disabled` alongside visual disabled states.
**Action:** Automatically map AI output to primary user input states with a clear call-to-action button, rather than requiring users to manually copy/re-enter data. Wrap async data regions in `aria-live` containers and explicitly set `aria-disabled` on loading triggers.
